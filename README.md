# Information

Newspaper is used to help notify users on your server about what is currently going on. You can edit the newspaper accordingly, going with what is happing on your server. For example, you could say 'Vote for our server at [link]' or 'New PvP server has been released!', then the majority of the players on your server would know about all of these events, just by reading the newspaper.

Installing the plugin itself is easy. Just drag the .jar file that you downloaded into your server's plugins folder, and do the same with any addons. Once it's installed, you can start up the server, and use all of the features as you would with any other plugin.
